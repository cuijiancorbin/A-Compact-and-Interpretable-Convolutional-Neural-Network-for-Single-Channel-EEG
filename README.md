The project contains 3 code files. They are implemented with Python 3.6.6.

"CompactCNN.py" contains the model.
required library: torch

"LeaveOneOut_acc.py" contains the leave-one-subject-out method to get the classifcation accuracies.
It requires the computer to have cuda supported GPU installed.
required library:torch,scipy,numpy,sklearn

"VisualizationTech.py" contains the visualization technique based on the CAM method (Class Activation Map).
It requires the computer to have cuda supported GPU installed.
required library:torch,scipy,numpy,matplotlib,mne
